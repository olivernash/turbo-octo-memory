          <p>This app will now record when you spent time in close contact with other people using this app.</p>
          <p>You’ll get an alert if your status changes.</p>
          <p>It’s important that you tell us if you develop any new symptoms.</p>

        <p>You can stay safe by washing your hands more regularly and avoiding large gatherings of people. <p>
        <p>Visit NHS 111 for more advice on protecting yourself and people you care about. <p>
        <p>Thank you for helping us slow the spread of coronavirus. <p>
        <h2>I’ve been diagnosed with coronavirus </h2>
        <p>If you’ve recently been diagnosed with coronavirus by your GP or a healthcare professional, they’ll give you a unique code.</p>
        <p>Adding your code alerts other nearby people using this app that they may have been exposed to coronavirus, so they know what they need to do to stay safe.</p>
        <p> If enough people do this, the spread of coronavirus can be slowed.</p>
